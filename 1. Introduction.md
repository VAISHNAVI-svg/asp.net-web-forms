**MVC in the context of ASP.NET stands for Model-View-Controller.**

- **Model**: Represents the data and the business logic of the application. It directly manages the data and rules of the application.
- **View**: Represents the UI (User Interface) of the application. It is responsible for displaying the data provided by the model in a format that the user can interact with.
- **Controller**: Acts as an intermediary between the Model and View. It handles user input, updates the Model, and returns the display output to the View.
